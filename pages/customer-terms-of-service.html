        <h1>Customer Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last Modified: March 14, 2022</p>
        <p>These Customer Terms of Service (“Customer Terms”) together with any documents referenced below (like our
            Privacy Policy) are, collectively, the “Agreement.” As long as you comply with the Agreement, we will
            provide you with access to and use of our version control and design workflow management platform as well as
            downloadable software that facilitates the use of the platform (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
        <p>This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Abstract Studio Design, Inc. (“Abstract”, “we”, “us”, or
            “our”) and you, the person accessing and using Services (referred to throughout the Agreement as “Customer,”
            “you” “your”, “yours” or “yourself”). By clicking to accept the Agreement, you acknowledge that you have
            read and understood the Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the
            terms of the Agreement, you must not click that you accept or access or use the Services.</p>
        <h1>Important information about the “Customer”</h1>
        <p>Some customers use our Services in connection with work for their employer, customers may also use our
            Services for their own, personal purposes. Thus, “Customer” (or “you” or “your”) may be either the business
            entity (or other organization that you represent) or you as an individual. If you are signed up for a
            subscription plan using your corporate email domain or are otherwise entering into a subscription plan on
            behalf of a business entity or other organization (e.g. to complete projects for your employer), the
            business entity or other organization on whose behalf you signed up is the Customer. By signing up on behalf
            of a business entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have all right, power, and
            authority to bind such entity or organization to the Agreement. If you signed up for a subscription to the
            Services and are not formally affiliated with a business entity or other organization (e.g. to use the
            Services for your own, personal purposes unaffiliated with your work for your employer), you, as an
            individual, are the Customer.</p>
        <p>You also understand and agree that if you sign up to use the Services in response to an invite you receive to
            join another party’s organization, your use of the Services will be governed by the terms of that party’s
            agreement with us and the terms of only the first 4 paragraphs of these Customer Terms. For example, you may
            be invited by another party to collaborate with such party on a project they are working on within the
            Services. When you work on such project within the Services, all materials, information, data, and other
            content you provide through the Services will be owned by such party under the terms of such party’s
            agreement with us. However, you represent and warrant to us that you have the right to grant such ownership
            rights to such party.</p>
